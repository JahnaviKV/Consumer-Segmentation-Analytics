Title: Enhancing Targeted Marketing through Data-Driven Insights

In today’s competitive market, understanding consumer behavior is essential for optimizing marketing strategies and improving brand loyalty. This project, conducted for AXANTEUS, a market research agency, focuses on developing a behavior-based segmentation model to overcome the limitations of traditional demographic segmentation.

Using data on demographics, purchasing patterns, and promotional responses, the analysis identifies value-conscious and brand-loyal consumer groups, enabling AXANTEUS’s clients to allocate budgets effectively, personalize campaigns, and improve loyalty outcomes.

🎯 Objectives
Business Goals

Transition from demographic-based to behavior-based segmentation.

Identify value-conscious consumers and brand-loyal customers.

Develop predictive models to support targeted marketing and promotion optimization.

Analytical Goals

Segment consumers by purchase behavior and basis for purchase using clustering.

Classify value-conscious consumers using supervised learning.

Predict brand loyalty and purchasing volume using regression models.

🧮 Methodology
1. Data Preparation

Dataset: 600 observations, 46 variables (demographic, purchase, and promotion data).

Cleaning: Handled missing and zero values, renamed columns for clarity.

Transformation: Standardized variables for clustering; applied PCA for dimensionality review (no reduction required).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Visualized relationships between demographic and behavioral features.

3. Segmentation Analysis

Used K-Means Clustering across three dimensions:

Purchase Behavior Segmentation

Cluster 1: High-volume, cost-conscious shoppers

Cluster 2: Average buyers with moderate brand engagement

Cluster 3: Loyal and promotion-driven consumers

Basis for Purchase Segmentation

Cluster 1: Balanced mid-tier buyers

Cluster 2: Premium consumers valuing exclusivity

Cluster 3: Price-sensitive, promotion-focused buyers

Combined Segmentation

Cluster 1: Balanced consumers

Cluster 2: Value-oriented, promotion-driven segment

Cluster 3: Premium brand-loyal consumers

🤖 Predictive Modeling
1. Classification – Predicting Value-Conscious Consumers

Models developed:

Model	Accuracy	AUC
Logistic Regression	58.9%	0.63
Decision Tree	63.9%	0.61
Random Forest	65.6%	0.65

📊 Best Model: Random Forest

Sensitivity: 76.4%

Specificity: 50.0%

Strong predictor of value-conscious consumer behavior.

2. Regression – Predicting Total Purchase Volume

Linear Regression: R² = 0.844 → Best fit with lower RMSE and MAE.

Regression Tree: Interpretable rules identifying key drivers such as Total Purchase Value, Education Level, and Socioeconomic Class.

💡 Business Impact

The segmentation approach enables AXANTEUS to:

Understand consumers beyond demographics.

Target promotions to cost-sensitive clusters (Value-Conscious).

Reward loyalty among premium brand buyers.

Optimize marketing spend through precision targeting.

Cluster	Segment Type	Marketing Focus
1	General Buyers	Mid-range offers, bundle promotions
2	Value-Oriented	Discounts, loyalty programs
3	Brand-Loyal Buyers	Premium access, exclusive rewards
📈 Recommendations

Value-Conscious Consumers: Emphasize discounts, flash sales, and reward programs.

Brand-Loyal Consumers: Highlight product quality and exclusivity (e.g., VIP campaigns).

General Buyers: Maintain engagement through regular, balanced marketing.

Continuously update segmentation models based on evolving consumer data.

🧠 Key Insights

Behavior-based segmentation provides a deeper understanding of what drives consumer choices.

Predictive models enable proactive targeting for both promotions and brand retention.

The Random Forest model offers the most reliable classification of value-conscious consumers.

Data-driven segmentation enhances AXANTEUS’s strategic recommendations for its clients.
